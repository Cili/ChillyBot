#### The Slightly More Deployable ChillyBot Files

I, Jon Cili, have made a multi-purpose Discord Bot that can complete the following tasks:
1. Censor swear words from lists of programmer-provided swear words.
2. Entertain by means of responding to specific command messages that start with the ampersand symbol.
3. Restrict specific users on a channel from speaking.
4. Provide the developer with general information about users and servers through the IDE terminal.

### How to Use the ChillyBot files
The code in this repository is merely a *framework*, as it requires some additional info to become fully deployable. All locations in the 6 files that say "***INSERT ___***" require manual insertion of information.

I hope you enjoy a more wholesome server as a result of my ChillyBot!
